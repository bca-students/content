### Q1. Explain the If-Else statement in VB.NET and Give one example
If-Else, also known as If-Then-Else statements are used for basic conditional logic.
- It conditionally executes a group of statements, depending on the value of an expression.

Syntax:
```vbnet
If condition Then
    statements
ElseIf condition2 Then
     More Statements
Else
     else statements
End If
```
Just like if statement, it is always followed by "End If" to show that the if-else block is over.

Example: 
```vbnet
Dim n As Integer = 5

If n Mod 2 = 0 Then
    Console.WriteLine("Even")
Else
    Console.WriteLine("Odd")
End If
```
