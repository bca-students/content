### Q1.List some popular client scripting languages and explain them.

Client side scripting languages are programming languages where the heavy processing happens client side, usually on the client application or on the web browser itself. Here are some client side scripting languages:
- HTML
    - Hyper Text Markup Language is a simple scripting language used to create the layout or structure of a web page.
    - Usually works in tandem with CSS for styling and JS for more advance scripting
- CSS
    - Cascading Style Sheets allow the developer to create the style, look, and feel of the page.
    - It allows you to customize the font, border styles, format, margins, paddings, etc
- JS
    - Javascript is a lightweight interpreted(or sometimes JIT compiled) language with easy to call functions.
    - This allows us to perform more advanced actions in our website/web page.
- React.js
    - React is a JavaScript framework that allows you to create dynamic and responsive web pages
    - Using React Native, we can even develop Android/iOS apps

### Q2.What is ".NET Framework"?
The .NET Framework is a software framework created by Microsoft for development of Windows Apps.

This provides a set of libraries, tools, and a runtime environment to build apps with programming languages like C#, F#, Visual Basic, etc. With some effort, you can compile to various targets like Windows Desktop, Linux(x11/xWayland), Mac, web, mobile, and even build games using Godot(C# through mono), Unity(C#, Only for scripting),

### Q3.What is "VB.NET"?
Visual Basic(previously known as VisualBasic.NET(VB.NET)) is an object oriented language for .NET, .NET Framewowrk and Mono

It is a successor to VB6 from .NET framework, and it supports OOP concepts like abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism. This means that everything in the language is an object.

It is not a case sensitive language, and is used to quickly develop a full object oriented program with full access to all libraries from the .NET Framework.

### Q4.Explain web technologies with examples
Web technology is used to describe all the different things people use to make websites and web-based applications. 
- This includes software and hardware tools, programming languages, and standards needed to create and run web apps on the internet. 
- Web technology comprises many areas, including web design, web development, web servers, web browsers, e-commerce, and content management systems.

We can simplify this into these classifications of Web Technology:
- ***Web servers***: 
    - They process requests and send responses to web browsers. Eg. Nginx, caddy, apache, etc
- ***Web browsers***: 
    - They are the tools we use to look at web pages. Eg. Chromium(Chrome, Brave, Edge), Gecko(Firefox), WebKit/WebKitGTK(Gnome Web, Safari) 
- ***HTML***: 
    - It's a language that helps structure and show content on web pages
- ***CSS***: 
    - It helps make web pages look pretty by adding colors, fonts, and styles
- ***JavaScript***: 
    - It's a language that makes web pages do cool stuff like animations and interactive features
- ***Backend Technologies***: 
    - They are the tools used to make the server-side parts of web apps work. Eg. ASP.NET, Golang, Python, Flask, Django, Ruby on Rails, etc
- ***Database Systems***: 
    - They store and retrieve data used in web apps. Eg. MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle SQL, NoSQL, etc

### Q5.Explain the advantages and disadvantages of client side and server-side technologies

#### Pros and Cons of Client-Side Scripting

- Pros:
    - Fast response time, as no server communication is needed.
    - Reduces server load, leading to a more scalable application.
- Cons:
    - Security risks, as the code can be seen and altered by users.
    - May behave differently in different browsers.

#### Pros and Cons of Server-Side Scripting

- Pros:
    - More secure, as the code is not exposed to clients.
    - Consistent across different browsers.
    - Can handle complex processing.
- Cons:
    - Can be slower, as it requires communication with the server.
    - Places more load on the server.
