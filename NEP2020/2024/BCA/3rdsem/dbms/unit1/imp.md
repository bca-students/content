# Unit 1: Database Architecture

## Important Questions

### Q1. define database.

A database is a collection of data that is structured and easy to access, manage and update. This can be anything like text, numbers, videos, images, files, and more.

### Q2. Define DBMS

A DBMS(Database Management System) is a software used to manage data in a database. This allows us to store, modify, update and delete data from a database.

Examples: MySQL, Oracle SQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc

### Q3. Why do we need DBMS?

A DBMS makes the following tasks a lot simpler:
- Data Organization and Management
    - A well-designed database schema enables faster access to information, reducing the time required to find relevant data. 
    - A DBMS also provides features like indexing and searching, which make it easier to locate specific data within the database. 
- Data Security and Privacy
    - They offer authentication and authorization features that control access to the database. 
    - DBMSs also provide encryption capabilities to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. 
- Data Integrity and Consistency
    - DBMSs provide mechanisms that ensure the accuracy and consistency of data. 
    - These mechanisms include constraints, triggers, and stored procedures that enforce data integrity rules
- Concurrent Data Access
    - DBMS provides a concurrent access mechanism that allows multiple users to access the same data simultaneously.
    - DBMSs use locking mechanisms to ensure that multiple users can access the same data without causing conflicts or data corruption.
